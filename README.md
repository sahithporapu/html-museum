HTML Museum is a basic project that explains important HTML tags and concepts in a simple, room-wise layout using only HTML.

🏛️ HTML Museum – An Interactive Guide to HTML Basics
Welcome to the HTML Museum, a beginner-friendly, creatively themed project that showcases the foundational elements of HTML through a series of "exhibit rooms".

Each room in this virtual museum explores a specific HTML concept — from headings and paragraphs to semantic tags, forms, iframes, lists, multimedia, and more. It's a visual and structured way to learn and revise HTML fundamentals.
